I've spent almost my entire adult life learning, configuring, and consuming open source software. This has led me down
a path where I have been able to contribute to open source as well.

This page exists to document the projects I've contributed to, and when possible, indicate the contributions made. I'm
building this so that I'll never be able to forget that I've been lucky enough to write code which (likely) runs on
millions of machines across the world.

These contributions have come from all stages of my career, and reading some of the code now makes me cringe -- but it was
good enough to be merged, and provided value at the time, and I can be proud of that anyway. The only items I'm not
including on this list are contributions to repositories that, while technically under an open source license, are not in
use by the general population.

Contributions:
 - [Fog](https://github.com/fog/fog) - a ruby cloud client toolkit
   - [Cleaned up, added tests for, and upstreamed existing fog plugin for Rackspace Monitoring API](https://github.com/fog/fog/commits?author=jayofdoom)
 - [gelfj2](https://github.com/mashintsev/gelfj2) - a GELF appender for log4j2
   - [Added GelfConsoleAppender](https://github.com/mashintsev/gelfj2/pull/1)
 - [etcd-watcher](https://github.com/jayofdoom/etcd-watcher)
   - Written entirely by me, etcd-watcher is a prototype in ruby utilizing etcd to heartbeat a key to monitor liveness.
