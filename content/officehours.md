Working remotely on open source can make it difficult to connect with people,
to get those impromptu mentoring or pair programming sessions that can happen
in passing. This is one thing I've personally missed about working in an office
on a local team. As I get more involved in OpenStack leadership, connecting
with people seems more important than ever -- so I have an idea to try and
replicate these benefits in a remote, open source context.

I'm going to start holding office hours on various live streaming venues;
starting with my [YouTube](https://youtube.com/jayofdoom/). Think of this as
time I've set aside to work with the community. My hope is that this can turn
into different things based on participation. If you're a person who is curious
what working on open source really looks like? Watch me work and talk through
what I'm doing, and see what working on open source looks like. Are you an
OpenStack contributor going through a hard problem, or need a code review on
something Ironic? Stop by and ask about it; I'll help if I can.

For now, I won't put these on a regular schedule, but will put a post up on my
twitter account, [@jayofdoom](https://twitter.com/jayofdoom) a day or two in
advance of an office hours session. If these get a lot of participation, or
if I find it a useful tool to get things done; I'll post and maintain a regular
schedule for office hours.

Let me know what you think of this idea! You can find me in #jayf on Libera,
on Twitter, or the various open source chat rooms I can be found in (usually
as "JayF").
