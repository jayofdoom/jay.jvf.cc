I am Jay Faulkner.

I've been in the tech industry since 2006, working up from a Junior Systems Admin to my current job as a Staff Software
Engineer. You may know me from my work on [OpenStack Ironic](http://ironicbaremetal.org/), which I used and contributed
to for several years of my career. Currently, I'm working on the Advanced Server Access team at Okta. Please note this
blog represents my opinions, and I do not speak for my employer.

One of my primary passions outside of work is hockey, specifically Seattle Kraken (NHL) and Seattle Thunderbirds (WHL).
I also enjoy video games, and sometimes streaming them on twitch as [TastyMcRib](https://twitch.tv/tastymcrib).
