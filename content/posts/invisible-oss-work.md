Just wanted to cross post something over on my personal blog.

I've been writing some blog posts on the Invisible Work of OpenStack, and
it looks like they're going to be published over at the
[G-Research Blog](https://www.gresearch.co.uk/news/). I'll keep this post
up to date with links to the posts as they are published.
