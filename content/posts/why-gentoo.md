I can't remember a time when computers weren't a part of my life. When I was five, my parents purchased a PC-XT clone, 
and quickly I was learning how to operate DOS after learning how to read and write. This obsession grew, as I would
disassemble and reassemble computers for fun -- and most of the time they kept working! Sure, computer gaming in the 90s
wasn't easy, but for me, part of the fun was just getting it working. As I grew older, I was insistent that my career 
lie outside of computing -- I wanted to help people, and leave working on computers to a hobby. That started
to change when I went to college, and heard about this new thing called linux.

Red Hat Linux, specifically, of course. I was at North Carolina State University after all. The local linux user group
[TriLUG](http://trilug.org) even met at the Red Hat HQ at NCSU's Centennial Campus. As that point, I didn't know or care
what "open source" meant, but I was impressed. One thing that especially stood out to me was OpenOffice.org -- and when
I looked into if I could help, I found they had a marketing project. I volunteered and shortly after was whisked off on
a couple of trips to staff booths about OpenOffice.org. A large number of people I met there showed me through their
generosity of time and spirit that open source might be a place where my desire to help people may intersect with my
interest in computers.

This fleeting interest turned into a tangible need quickly. I was given stewardship of [oldos.org](https://oldos.org),
and I couldn't afford expensive hosting. The kind folks at [Linode](https://www.linode.com) helped by donating one of
their smallest cloud servers (then called a "VPS") and kept us running for several years. That just started the hard 
part for me: sustaining over 1 million hits a month for a large PHP wiki and forum software. I was able to teach myself
how to do this by reading documentation, asking questions, and running the same sort of software that, back then, might
have been running the largest websites on the web.

The knowledge I learned from keeping [oldos.org](https://oldos.org) online combined with the contacts I gained in the
local community kickstarted my career.
