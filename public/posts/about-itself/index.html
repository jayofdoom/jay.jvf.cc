        <p>It&rsquo;s been a long time since I&rsquo;ve posted regularly to the internet &ndash; short or long form. As I get older, I find I don&rsquo;t
enjoy publishing in Facebook or Twitter-sized snippets. So I decided to try and start blogging on a longer form again.</p>
<p>My primary topic will be the various personal projects I&rsquo;ve started working on in the last few years. None of this is
to be seen as a review or endorsement of the products or software I&rsquo;ve used. Some of it was picked nearly at random.
Such as the static site generator I&rsquo;m using for this, <a href="https://gohugo.io" title="gohugo.io">hugo</a>. I found it by simply
Googling for a static site generator in go, and picking the first response on Google. It&rsquo;s been so easy I&rsquo;ve never
thought of trying anything else.</p>
<p>First, why a static site generator? One of my goals was to make sure my blog would be near-zero upkeep outside
of writing new posts. My previous experience with the main <a href="http://oldos.org" title="OldOs.org">oldos.org</a> website taught me
that dynamic blogging/wiki software means either ignoring blatant software vulnerabilities or signing up for a nightmare
of maintenance. Part of why I stopped updating that site is because the software running it, PMWiki, was too heavily
modified by my custom theme to easily apply security updates. It runs today as a static archive on Google Sites &ndash; part
of why it&rsquo;s no longer maintained. I&rsquo;m using these lessons to guide how I set up this blog &ndash; perhaps in the future I
could even adapt oldos.org&rsquo;s theme to use hugo and migrate the content.</p>
<p>Hugo was pleasantly simple to get going &ndash; there was an ebuild available for it with Gentoo which I installed, then I
followed the <a href="https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/" title="Hugo Quick Start">hugo quick start</a>, found a
<a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/" title="Hugo Themes">theme</a>, and I was up and running in a few minutes. I found and installed the
IDEA plugin for hugo, which manages the hugo server for me, and now I&rsquo;m watching it open in my browser updating live
each time it saves.</p>
<p>I can also at a later point add more static pages &ndash; I would expect this to become the permanent home of my resume, for
instance. For now, I&rsquo;m happy it allows me to publish this site without having to have a menu or alternate pages at all.
That means I was able to go from zero to having this post drafted in less than ninety minutes. This kind of low-friction
blogging is the only way I&rsquo;ll be able to keep this updated regularly.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to save this draft, revise it, then get hosting setup. My next post will detail how I&rsquo;m hosting it! Other
topics you can expect to come up  as I get through them may include &ldquo;Why I run Gentoo&rdquo;, &ldquo;My home router setup&rdquo;, and a
whole series of posts on my  experiences with Home Assistant, and the journey I&rsquo;m undergoing to smartify my home.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading,</p>
<p>Jay</p>
